# Day 4 - Redirection & Piping

## Commands Learned
- `>` -> redirect and overwrite
- `>>` -> apend output
- `<` -> read from file
- `|` -> pipe output between commands
- `tee` -> display and save simultaneously
- `&&`, `||`, `;` -> command chaining

## Reflections
Practiced redirection and pipelines to automate simple data flows. Learned how to chain multiple tools effectively for log and text manipulation.
