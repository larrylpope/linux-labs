# Day 2 - Filesystem & File Operations

## Commands Learned
- `pwd` -> show current directory
- `ls -la` -> list files (including hidden)
- `mkdir`, `touch`, `echo`, `cat` -> create/manage files
- `mv`, `cp`, `rm` -> move, copy, delete
- Absolute vs relative paths

## Reflections
Learned how to navigate the Linux filesystem and create/move/delete files.
