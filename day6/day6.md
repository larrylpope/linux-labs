# Day 6 – Users & Groups

## Commands Learned
- `id` → Show user and group IDs
- `groups` → Show group memberships
- `who` / `whoami` → Identify logged-in users
- `adduser` / `deluser` → Create and remove users
- `passwd` → Change passwords
- `sudo` → Execute privileged commands
- `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, `/etc/shadow` → User and group databases

## Reflections
Learned how user identities, groups, and privileges are structured in Linux. Practiced creating and switching users, inspecting group memberships, and understanding sudo access.
