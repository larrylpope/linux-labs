# Day 3 - Text Search & Manipulation

## Commands Learned
- `grep` -> search text by pattern
- `find` -> locate files
- `cut` -> extract fields
- `sort` -> sort lines
- `wc` -> count lines/words/bytes
- Combined commands with pipes

## Reflections
Practiced searching logs and extracting structured data. Combining `grep`, `cut`, and `sort` with pipes is powerful for quick analysis.
