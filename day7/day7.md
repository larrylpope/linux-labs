# Day 7 - Permissions & Ownership

## Commands Learned
- `ls -l` -> View permissions and ownership
- `chmod` -> Change permissions (symbolic and numeric)
- `chown` -> Change file owner
- `chgrp` -> Change file group
- Permission bits: `r` (4), `w` (2), `x` (1)
- Directory permissions differ slightly (`x` = enter, `r` = list)

## Reflections
Learned how to interpret and adjust Linux permissions and ownership. Practiced symbolic vs numeric modes and saw how restricted directories behave.
